To show projects I've been working on

 - Folder Cleaner
         (Move files to folders based on file type)
 - Mouse Mover
         (Move mouse to prevent AFK. It can work in background and is activated after 10s of users inactivity.)
 - Housing Market Bot
         (to get and store online listings of real estate in given city. Updated each run. 
          Collect data to analyse it later)
